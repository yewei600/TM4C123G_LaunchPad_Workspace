This means the roads must both be red before the walk light is activated. 

In a similar fashion, when a car sensor is 0V, it means no cars are waiting to enter the intersection. The don't walk light should be on while cars have a green or yellow light.


 Often we will need to have multiple states with the same output value
 
 
 
 push walk button
 
 cars    ped
 RR       G
 no switch pressed,  stays in that state
 
 now there's a car, or 2 cars
 RR       don't walk (R flashes) (for little time)
 
 1R1G     R
